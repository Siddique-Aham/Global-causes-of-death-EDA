#  Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Causes of Death

This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a global dataset of causes of death, sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to identify the most frequent causes of death, visualize the trends, and extract meaningful insights that can support further public health analysis and decision-making.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

### 1. **Data Loading**
- Used the Kaggle API to search for datasets containing information about causes of death.
- Downloaded and extracted the dataset programmatically.
- Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

### 2. **Data Exploration**
- Viewed the first few rows of the dataset.
- Checked column types, number of unique values, and null counts.
- Generated descriptive statistics for numerical data.

### 3. **Data Cleaning**
- Verified no missing values existed.
- Ensured columns had appropriate data types.
- Removed non-relevant columns (`Country/Territory`, `Year`, `Code`) for analysis.

### 4. **Analysis**
- Aggregated the total number of deaths for each cause across all countries and years.
- Sorted and identified the top 10 causes of death globally.

### 5. **Visualization**
- Created a bar chart showing the 10 most frequent causes of death using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.

## üìä Key Findings

- The dataset contains **6,120 rows** and **34 columns**, with **no missing values**.
- The **top 10 causes of death globally** (based on total deaths across all entries) are:

  1. Cardiovascular Diseases  
  2. Neoplasms  
  3. Chronic Respiratory Diseases  
  4. Lower Respiratory Infections  
  5. Neonatal Disorders  
  6. Diarrheal Diseases  
  7. Digestive Diseases  
  8. Tuberculosis  
  9. Cirrhosis and Other Chronic Liver Diseases  
  10. HIV/AIDS

- Cardiovascular diseases are by far the most significant contributor to global mortality.

## üîÆ Future Work

- **Trend Analysis**: Investigate how causes of death change over time.
- **Geographic Comparison**: Compare death causes by country or region.
- **Normalization**: Incorporate population data to compute death rates per capita.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning to predict future mortality trends.
